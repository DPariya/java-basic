# Dipti’s DSA & System Design Prep

Welcome to the Interview Preparation repository by **Dipti Pariya**, focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **System Design**.  
This repo is organized to help you efficiently prepare for software engineering interviews.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

- `beginner/` — Basic DSA problems to build strong foundations.
- `advanced-dsa/` — Complex and challenging algorithmic problems for in-depth practice.
- `system-design/` — System design concepts, patterns, and real-world case studies.

---

## 📚 Problem Format

Each problem folder contains:

- **Problem Statement:** Clear description of the problem.
- **Input/Output:** Example inputs and expected outputs.
- **LeetCode Number:** Reference to the original LeetCode problem for further practice.
- **Solutions:** One or more solution files implementing different approaches or optimizations. Solutions are well-commented for clarity.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. Start with the `beginner` folder to get comfortable with essential data structures and algorithms.
2. Progress to `advanced-dsa` for tackling harder problems that require deeper problem-solving skills.
3. Study the `system-design` folder to understand designing scalable and maintainable systems through examples and case studies.
4. Use the LeetCode links for interactive practice and to explore additional solutions.
5. Review multiple solutions where provided to learn different approaches and optimize your code.

---

## 📝 Best Practices

- Read the problem statement carefully before looking at solutions.
- Try to solve problems on your own first, then compare with the provided solutions.
- Write clean and readable code with proper comments.
- Understand the time and space complexity of each solution.
- Regularly revisit problems to reinforce learning.
